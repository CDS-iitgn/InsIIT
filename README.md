## InsIIT - IITGn's Official Institute App

You've stumbled across the official FOSS repository of IITGn's Institute App! This project is in its infant stages, and all contributions in any form are welcome :)

## Motivation
Kicked off on HackRush 2019, this project was brought to life with a vision to create a one-stop-serves-all platform for all members of the community. The project incorporates several aspects of the campus, and deeply integrates into services that we use daily. Our vision is to see this project becoming a one-of-a-kind open source project that allows students to up-skill themselves while contributing to something that everyone on campus uses!

## Tech/framework used
- Frontend - Flutter
- Backend - Node.js + MongoDb, Google Sheets

## Features
- TODO

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API's

A large part of this project runs off the Google Sheet API due to its ease of being modified without any technical knowledge whatsoever. This will change as and when a proper server has been hosted later.
